                                        When you outsource a CFO, you wonâ€™t have the obligation of paying full salaries, taxes,
                                        benefits and providing other facilities. Outsourcing a CFO would mean paying them only
                                        when they work. It works like wonders, especially when you are running a small or medium-sized
                                        business because a virtual CFO Services will take off the financial strain from your firm.

                                        When CFO works in-house, he becomes a part of the team. It means all the passwords, sensitive information,
                                        and data are freely shared with him. It can increase the chances of other employees getting access to such
                                        sensitive and confidential data, leading to increased risk. While an outsourced CFO, on the other hand,
                                        has access to financial data on a need-to-know basis. It helps in maintaining control over the financial data
                                        and takes care of the security concerns.

                                        A startup, small-sized business, or medium-sized business requires a person who is part of it to take up various roles.
                                        In such cases, an in-house CFO might end up spending a lot of time on activities that may not be directed towards the financial goals of the company.
                                        It might be disastrous as much of his time is spent on something for which he is not even hired. However, an outsourced CFO focuses on handling only the financial management of the firm.
                                        It helps him concentrate on the tasks that support the business in getting closer to the desired financial goals.
