                        After the introduction of GST on July 1, 2017, GST replaced all the
                        indirect taxes, including VAT, service tax, excise duty, customs
                        duty, stamp duty, securities transaction tax, and many more.{" "}

                        With the introduction of the GST Act, the system is expected to
                        become more transparent and fair. However, the new system has also
                        raised complexities because of the newness of the law and the higher
                        number of compliance requirements. Therefore, businesses are at a
                        crossroads with no accurate directions to follow. This is where KMS
                        plays a big role in removing your doubts and helping you in
